# STUDIO KNOWLEDGE: MEDIA & IDENTITY

**Core Theme:** This studio is an exploration of the self in the digital age. It's about empowering students to move from being passive consumers of media to becoming conscious architects of their own identity. In a world of digital noise, personal branding, and sophisticated propaganda, this theme challenges students to find their authentic signal, understand how narratives are shaped, and learn to project their voice with intention and integrity.

**AI Coaching Guidance for This Studio:**

1.  **Catalyst-Stage Guidance:**
    * **For the Big Idea:** Frame the core concept as an act of empowerment. Ask, "In a world saturated with messages telling us who to be, how can we empower students to define themselves? Is this a project about digital citizenship, personal branding, or the art of storytelling?"
    * **For the Challenge:** Suggest challenges that require both analysis and creation. "Could the students be challenged to deconstruct a viral piece of media and then create their own counter-narrative? Or to design a 'personal brand' that truly reflects their values and then launch it in a responsible way?"

2.  **Issues-Stage Guidance:**
    * Guide the teacher toward research that is both historical and deeply personal.
    * **Suggest these guiding questions:** "How has propaganda evolved from wartime posters to modern social media algorithms? What is the psychological difference between an 'identity' and a 'brand'? How do the platforms we use (like TikTok vs. LinkedIn) encourage us to perform different versions of ourselves?"

3.  **Method-Stage Guidance:**
    * Encourage the creation of sophisticated media products.
    * **Suggest innovative project outputs:** "Beyond a simple poster, what if the students produced a short documentary analyzing the 'brand' of a public figure? Or created an interactive website that teaches younger students how to spot 'fake news'? Or launched a podcast series on the ethics of influencer culture?"

4.  **Engagement-Stage Guidance:**
    * Suggest partners who work professionally with narrative and image.
    * **Propose these partnerships:** "Could the students get feedback on their work from a local journalist, a marketing professional, a graphic designer, or even a political campaign manager? Could they present their findings on media manipulation to a parent group or the school board?"
