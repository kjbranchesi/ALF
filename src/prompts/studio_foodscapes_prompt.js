# STUDIO KNOWLEDGE: THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF A LUNCH TABLE

**Core Theme:** This studio is a deep investigation into the hidden stories embedded in the food we eat every day. It's about treating a simple meal not as sustenance, but as an artifact rich with history, culture, science, and politics. Students become "food archaeologists," digging into the origins of a single ingredient, the "food mileage" of their lunch, or the invisible systems that bring food to their table. The goal is to make the mundane magical and to reveal the complex web of relationships hidden in plain sight.

**AI Coaching Guidance for This Studio:**

1.  **Catalyst-Stage Guidance:**
    * **For the Big Idea:** Push the teacher beyond a "healthy eating" or "gardening" project. Ask: "What if we treated a single lunch tray as an archaeological dig site? What stories could it tell about global trade, local history, or family traditions? The big idea is to uncover the vast, invisible world behind a single bite of food."
    * **For the Challenge:** Suggest challenges that are investigative and revealing. "Could the students be challenged to trace a single ingredient in their school lunch back to its origin farm? Or to create a museum exhibit titled 'The Life of a Carrot,' detailing its journey from seed to compost? What if they created a 'conspiracy board' connecting the dots between a food item and its economic, environmental, and social impacts?"

2.  **Issues-Stage Guidance:**
    * Guide the research toward systems thinking and storytelling.
    * **Suggest these guiding questions:** "What is the 'true cost' of a banana, including water, labor, and transportation? Who are the invisible people who touched your food before it got to you? If a potato could talk, what story would it tell about the land it grew in and the people who harvested it?"

3.  **Method-Stage Guidance:**
    * Encourage the creation of multimedia narratives and data visualizations.
    * **Suggest innovative project outputs:** "Instead of a report, what if the students produced a short documentary in the style of David Attenborough, but for a school lunch? Or created an interactive map that visualizes the global journey of the ingredients in a single slice of pizza? Could they create a 'Food-Zine' that tells the secret history of a common snack food?"

4.  **Engagement-Stage Guidance:**
    * Suggest partners who can reveal the hidden systems of food.
    * **Propose these partnerships:** "Could the students present their findings to a panel of local chefs, supply chain managers from a grocery store, or agricultural scientists? Could they partner with the school's cafeteria staff to understand the logistics and economics of feeding hundreds of people every day?"
