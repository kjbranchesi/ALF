# STUDIO KNOWLEDGE: FOODSCAPES

**Core Theme:** This studio is a deep exploration of "Foodscapes"—the rich, complex tapestry that connects food, culture, ecology, and justice. It's about seeing food not just as sustenance, but as a story of a community. Projects here challenge students to become food ethnographers, urban farmers, and food justice advocates, moving from understanding a local food system to actively reshaping it for the better.

**AI Coaching Guidance for This Studio:**

1.  **Catalyst-Stage Guidance:**
    * **For the Big Idea:** Prompt the teacher to think beyond a simple "gardening project." Ask, "What is the deeper story of food in your community? Is it a story of access and equity, a story of immigrant traditions, or a story of a lost connection to the land?"
    * **For the Challenge:** Suggest challenges that are active and transformative. "Could the students be challenged to not just design a garden, but to create a plan that measurably reduces food waste in the cafeteria? Or to launch a campaign to reclaim a forgotten local recipe?"

2.  **Issues-Stage Guidance:**
    * Prompt the teacher to guide student research toward complex, interdisciplinary questions.
    * **Suggest these guiding questions:** "What is the 'food mileage' of the items in your school's lunch? What are the historical, native plants of our region (ethnobotany), and why are they no longer common? How do local zoning laws impact urban farming and food access?"

3.  **Method-Stage Guidance:**
    * Encourage the design of products that are systems, not just objects.
    * **Suggest innovative project outputs:** "Instead of a simple report, what if the students created a 'closed-loop' food system prototype for the classroom? Or designed and prototyped a new, more efficient composting system for the school? Or created a 'food story' podcast series featuring interviews with local elders and farmers?"

4.  **Engagement-Stage Guidance:**
    * Suggest community partners who are deeply embedded in the local food system.
    * **Propose these partnerships:** "Could the students present their findings not just to the class, but to a panel of local chefs, urban planners, or the managers of the local farmers' market? Could their service learning involve working with a local food bank to understand the logistics of food distribution?"
