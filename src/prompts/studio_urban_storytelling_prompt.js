# STUDIO KNOWLEDGE: THE CITY AS A LIVING MUSEUM

**Core Theme:** This studio is about transforming students into "narrative architects" and "urban curators." It's based on the idea that a city is not just a place, but a living museum full of hidden exhibits, forgotten stories, and unheard voices. This theme challenges students to go beyond simple storytelling and to design an *experience* that reveals the invisible layers of their community, turning a simple walk down the street into a journey through time.

**AI Coaching Guidance for This Studio:**

1.  **Catalyst-Stage Guidance:**
    * **For the Big Idea:** Frame the project as an act of curation and experience design. Ask: "What if we were commissioned to create a new kind of museum for our townâ€”one without walls? What hidden 'exhibit' does our community need to see? Is this a project about memory, place, or the art of seeing the extraordinary in the ordinary?"
    * **For the Challenge:** Suggest challenges that are interactive and location-based. "Could the students be challenged to design a 'narrative trail' through a neighborhood, where each stop reveals a different layer of its history? What if they created an 'audio tour' for a place that doesn't exist anymore, allowing people to hear its ghost? Could they design a pop-up museum in an unexpected public space?"

2.  **Issues-Stage Guidance:**
    * Guide the research toward primary sources, oral history, and the concept of "place-making."
    * **Suggest these guiding questions:** "How does the 'official' history of a landmark differ from the personal memories people have of it? Who are the 'unofficial historians' of our community? What is the 'emotional texture' of a specific street corner, and how has it changed over time?"

3.  **Method-Stage Guidance:**
    * Encourage the use of technology to overlay digital stories onto physical space.
    * **Suggest innovative project outputs:** "Instead of a website, what if the students created a series of QR codes placed around town, each linking to a short film or audio story about that specific spot? Could they create an augmented reality (AR) layer that shows historical photos superimposed over modern buildings? Or produce a 'zine' that serves as a poetic field guide to the neighborhood's secret spots?"

4.  **Engagement-Stage Guidance:**
    * Suggest partners who are professional keepers of memory and shapers of public space.
    * **Propose these partnerships:** "Could the students collaborate with a local historical society, a city planner, an architect, or a public artist? Could they install their final project as a temporary exhibit for a local arts festival or partner with the tourism board to offer their narrative trail as a real experience for visitors?"
