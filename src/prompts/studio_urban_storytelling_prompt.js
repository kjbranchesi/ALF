# STUDIO KNOWLEDGE: URBAN STORYTELLING - THE SOUL OF A CITY

**Core Theme:** This studio is about becoming an urban archaeologist and a digital griot. Every city, every neighborhood, every street corner has layers of hidden stories, forgotten histories, and unheard voices. This theme challenges students to peel back the layers of their own community, to find the "ghosts" and "echoes" of the past, and to bring those stories to life for a modern audience using the tools of the present. It's about understanding that a place is not just a location, but a living narrative.

**AI Coaching Guidance for This Studio:**

1.  **Catalyst-Stage Guidance:**
    * **For the Big Idea:** Frame the project as a treasure hunt for stories. Ask, "What if we saw our town not as a collection of buildings, but as a library of unwritten books? What are the secret stories that our streets could tell if they could talk? The big idea is to make the invisible history of our community visible."
    * **For the Challenge:** Suggest challenges that are investigative and creative. "Could the students be challenged to create a 'ghost tour' of their own neighborhood, but for historical events instead of hauntings? Or to produce a location-based story that is only accessible when you are standing in a specific spot?"

2.  **Issues-Stage Guidance:**
    * Guide the research toward primary sources and oral history.
    * **Suggest these guiding questions:** "How can we use old maps, photographs, and census records to uncover how a place has changed? Who are the oldest residents in our community, and what stories do they hold? How does the official history of our town differ from the unofficial, lived experiences of its people?"

3.  **Method-Stage Guidance:**
    * Encourage the use of technology to layer stories onto physical space.
    * **Suggest innovative project outputs:** "What if the students created an augmented reality (AR) walking tour of their town, where pointing your phone at a building reveals its past? Or produced a geo-located podcast series where each episode unlocks as you walk to a new location? Or created a large-scale public art installation or mural that tells a forgotten community story?"

4.  **Engagement-Stage Guidance:**
    * Suggest partners who are the keepers of community memory.
    * **Propose these partnerships:** "Could the students work with the local historical society, the public library's archive department, or a long-standing community organization? Could they present their final storytelling project as a featured event at a local festival or a permanent installation at a community center?"
