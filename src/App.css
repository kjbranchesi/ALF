/* =================================================================
   App.css for ALF Coach (V10 Modernization)
   =================================================================

   NOTE: This file is intentionally minimal.

   In modern React applications like this one, component-specific
   styles are often handled directly within the component files
   (as seen in App.jsx with the 'styles' object) or through
   CSS-in-JS libraries or utility-first frameworks like Tailwind CSS.

   The original Vite template included styles (e.g., #root, .logo)
   that were constraining the application layout and causing the
   width and alignment issues.

   These have been removed to give full stylistic control to the
   App.jsx component, which now manages its own layout, ensuring a
   predictable, full-screen experience without conflicts from
   global stylesheets.

   Any future global styles (like CSS variable definitions or
   very basic resets) could be added here.
